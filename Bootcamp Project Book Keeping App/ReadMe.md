# Book Keeping Application
A backend application designed to keep track of a user's reading activities. The application supports full CRUD operations, enabling users to create, view, update, and delete books they have read. It also features various endpoints for handling different operations, with data persistence managed through a PostgreSQL database.

**S** - Upon completing the bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a backend application to demonstrate our understanding of the material covered. The choice of project topic was left to us. As an avid reader, I decided to create a backend application to track my reading history. This would be beneficial for recalling not only the content of books I have read but also their titles.

**T** - I chose to develop this project using Java, the second language I learned during bootcamp. I used Spring Boot for the backend to manage routing, schemas, and HTTP requests. PostgreSQL was selected as the database due to its intuitive integration with Spring Boot. I set up tables for users and books, using primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between them. This project was developed independently, with Git used for version control.

**A** - I independently developed a fully functional backend server connected to a database with complete CRUD functionality. Establishing the relationships between the tables was a challenging initial hurdle, as this was my first personal project utilizing a relational database. Another challenge was configuring routing with Spring Boot, as this was my first experience developing outside the JavaScript ecosystem.

**R** - The completed application effectively demonstrated the various concepts covered during the backend module of the bootcamp. It successfully fulfilled its purpose of showcasing my knowledge and effort in learning these new concepts and building applications with them. Overall, I learned that working with new languages presents valuable opportunities for growth and becoming a more proficient programmer.

# Competencies
___
### JF 3.2 - Can explain the principles and uses of relational and non-relational databases.
One of the initial design decisions for this project was determining how to store the data. Although I had prior experience with non-relational databases, I concluded that a relational database would better suit the projectâ€™s requirements. The need to manipulate and retrieve data under specific conditions, as well as the core relationship between books and readers, made a relational database the ideal choice.

### JF 3.4 - Can create a logical and maintainable codebase.
This project marked my first experience working with Java. I emphasized and adhered to best practices, particularly in directory structure. I organized related functions logically and separated concerns to facilitate clear communication between services. Understanding this structure was one of the most enlightening aspects of the project.
