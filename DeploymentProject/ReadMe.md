Dockerizing applications to facilitate seamless collaboration within development teams.
Leveraging virtual environments to eliminate dependency conflicts.
# Personal Contributions
____
**S** - While upskilling and learning on the job, Multiverse tasked us with creating a project centered around CI/CD to demonstrate our competencies.

**T**: I decided to dockerize an already existing project to make continuous development easier. The project in question was a portfolio built for our frontend module using React, Bootstrap, and Material-UI. By dockerizing this existing application, I aimed to simplify the development process and facilitate collaboration.

**A** - Dockerizing the application allows for rapid improvements and updates to the portfolio. The main challenge I faced was getting acquainted with the fundamental concepts of Docker, which turned out to be a highly educational experience.

**R** - The project successfully achieved its intended purpose. I gained valuable insights into the CI/CD lifecycle and identified areas for further development, such as automating continuous integration and continuous deployment.

# Competencies
___
### JF 1.2 - Can describe the roles and responsibilities within the Software Development Lifecycle
This project served as a foundational step in deepening my understanding of the various facets of software engineering. Initially, I had limited exposure to deployment, CI/CD, and the overall process of maintaining an application post-development. This project provided an eye-opening experience in those areas.

### JF 1.5 - Can work effectively and contribute appropriately within a team
The primary goal behind this project was to facilitate collaborative work. By dockerizing the application, multiple developers can quickly get involved in improving the project without worrying about setting up development environments or resolving dependency issues. They can simply jump in and start contributing immediately!
