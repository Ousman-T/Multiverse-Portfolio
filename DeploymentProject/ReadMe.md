# Deployment Module
____
My deployment module aims to demonstrate core competencies of CI/CD lifecycle. My rationale behind creating this project was to make setting up development environments on this project a much more seamless process through docker. Utilizing the virtualization of docker, one must not worry about dependency conflicts when wanting to work on this project. Simply run through docker and jump right into the development process!

## Users 
____
Fellow Software Engineers looking to seamlessly collaborate on projects together.

# Personal Contributions 
____
**S** - While upskilling and learning on the job, Multiverse tasked us with creating a project based around CI/CD in order to display competencies. <br/>
**T** - I decided to instead dockerize an already built project in order to make continuously working on the project easier to do. The project was a portfolio built for our front end module using react, bootstrap, and material ui, I decided to dockerize this already existing application. <br/>
**A** Due to dockerizing the application, improvements can be made to the portfolio at the blink of an eye! My main challenge was getting familiar with the fundamental basics of Docker, which ended up being a real interesting learning opportunity. <br/>
**R** - Project completely fulfilled the intended purpose of it. I've learned a lot about the CI/CD lifecycle and also identified areas of growth, like automating continuous integration or continuous deployment. 
# Competencies 
____
### JF 1.2 Can describe the roles and responsibilities of the Software Development Lifecycle
This project acted as a jumping off point for me to get a more detailed understanding of the different aspects of Software Engineering. Initially I never thought much about deployment, CI/CD and the overall process of maintaining the application I learned to create, but this was a very eye-opening experience.
### JF 1.5 Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team 
The initial goal behind creating this project was to make working collaboratively an easier job. Dockerizing the application would allow for many different developers to jumnp in and get right to improving the application, without worrying about setting up development environments too much or downloading dependencies the project relies on. Just jump in, and get right to it!
