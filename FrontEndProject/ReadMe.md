# Personal Contributions
____
**S** - During our front end module of Multiverse, we were tasked with creating a project in order to display the new skills learned throughout the module. The project must cover topics learned during said module, but the project in itself was left up to us. <br/>
**T** - I decided to build a portfolio in order to showcase some front end projects I've worked on in the past. I decided on such because I've had previous front end projects created, but never a space to showcase them in their outcome. All projects were deployed through Netlefy. The portfolio itself was designed and built using react. Frameworks like bootstrap, material-ui, and react-router-dom were also utilized in the development process. I could've built my front end using Vue.js, but in my research I realized that react was the more integrated framework with more support for what I need. The app was layed out with three main routes: home, history, and about. I've also incorperated an API in order to fetch daily quotes. This was done in order to add a bit of good energy upon landing, while also displaying the ability to properly fetch and render data asynchroniously. <br/>
**A** Overall the peoject hit all of Multiverse's requirements, while also becoming a very beneficial project for me to have built. The main challenge I had with this project was styling. It really showed me the importance of understanding the fundamental aspects of CSS, before even diving into frameworks. Overall I've learned a lot, and I've identified key areas of designing and styling that I can get better at. <br>
**R** Overall, the app received a passing grade for Multiverse's module. It also put me in position to own and showcase a portfolio, that was designed in a way I can easily continuously update it to reflect future projects created, as long as adding other already built projects over time.

# Competencies

# JF 2.3 - Can develop effective user interfaces
This project was essentailly about building a user friendly front end in order to display my other talents as a Software Engineer. The app was structured in a way to make navigation easy and important information easy to find. It's also been created in a manner that allows for continuous implementation and improvements. <br>
# JF 2.5 - Can implement a responsive user interface
I could've designed this application with vanilla javascript, and display my pages on seperate documents. However, I chose to use react specifically to make interaction with the app as seamless as possible. Using routing in order to delegate data to appropriate pages ensures that everything is placed where the intended user would expect to find it. The webpage was also designed with mobile apps in mind, making sure that design patterns react to the sizing of the device being used.<br>
# JF 2.7 Effectively manage state for complex user interfaces
This application definitely required some state management, especially for managing the daily quotes. I would pull the data from a 3rd party api in JSON format. I would then render said data onto the UI through state management.
