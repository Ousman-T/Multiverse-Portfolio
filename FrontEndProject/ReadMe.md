**S** - During the frontend module of Multiverse, we were tasked with creating a project to demonstrate the skills learned throughout the module. While the project needed to cover the topics studied, the choice of the project itself was left to us.

**T** -I decided to build a portfolio to showcase some of the frontend projects I have worked on in the past. I chose this approach because I had previously created frontend projects but never had a dedicated platform to display them effectively. All projects were deployed through Netlify. The portfolio was designed and developed using React. Frameworks like Bootstrap, Material-UI, and React Router were also used in the development process. Although I considered using Vue.js, my research showed that React offered better integration and support for my needs. The app was structured with three main routes: Home, Projects, and About. I also integrated an API to fetch daily quotes to add a positive element upon landing, while also demonstrating my ability to fetch and render data asynchronously.

**A** - The project met all of Multiverse's requirements and proved to be a valuable project for me to build. The primary challenge I faced was with styling. This experience emphasized the importance of understanding fundamental CSS concepts before delving into frameworks. I gained a lot of knowledge and identified key areas of design and styling that I can improve upon.

**R** - The app received a passing grade for the Multiverse module. It also provided me with a platform to showcase my portfolio, designed to be easily updated with new projects as they are created and to add existing ones over time.

# Competencies
___
JF 2.3 - Can develop effective user interfaces
This project was essentially about creating a user-friendly frontend to display my other skills as a software engineer. The app was structured to make navigation intuitive and information easy to find. It was also developed to allow for continuous enhancement and updates.

JF 2.5 - Can implement a responsive user interface
Although I could have designed this application using vanilla JavaScript and displayed the pages on separate documents, I chose React to make interaction with the app as seamless as possible. Utilizing routing to navigate data to the appropriate pages ensures that everything is placed where users would expect to find it. The website was also designed with mobile devices in mind, ensuring that the design adapts to the screen size of the device being used.

JF 2.7 - Can effectively manage state for complex user interfaces
This application required state management, especially for managing the daily quotes. I retrieved data from a third-party API in JSON format and rendered it onto the UI through state management.
