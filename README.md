This repository houses many of the different projects I've worked on during my apprenticeship with Warner Music Group. This apprenticeship has offered me the opportunity to learn valuable skills while also working and putting those skills to use. I've grown from an inexperienced developer into a well rounded Software Engineer through this apprenticeship. Here are a few projects to showcase the different aspects of learning I've worked on.  


## Apprenticeship Overview

# Portfolio Introduction

My name is Ousman Touray, and over the past 15 months I've been working as a backend software engineer at Warner Music Group. I've learned a lot during my apprenticeship, but even before that, I was always eager to learn. I initially got into coding because I simply wanted to modify video games, and someday make my own. That childlike ambition lead me down the road of learning web development, enrolling in a bootcamp to learn fullstack MERN development. I continued to learn and actively search for opportunity, which eventually end up with Multiverse, where I learned more core concepts of Computer Science from coaches before learning on the job with actual tasks.

Software Engineering is something I'm passionate about mainly because of the creation of it. I've always been fascinated at the fact that people are able to create entire applications, websites, and video games through coding. Being able to take an idea and actually manifest it into a product is truly inspiring. Working on maintaining and adding new functionality to already existing applications has been nothing short of eye-opening and amazing for me.
